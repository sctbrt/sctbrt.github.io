# Scott Bertrand

This repository contains the source for **ScottBertrand.com** — an independent design office focused on systems that make work feel lighter.

The work centers on operational clarity: how work moves, where decisions stall, and why simple things become harder to maintain as complexity grows. The focus is on practical systems, brand and decision frameworks, and tools that teams can rely on under real-world constraints.

This is not a portfolio site. It is a working foundation for an office in formation.

## Structure
- Plain HTML and CSS
- Typography-first, minimal interface
- No build step; deployed directly via GitHub Pages

## Notes
The site is intentionally restrained. Content is added only when it adds weight or clarity.
